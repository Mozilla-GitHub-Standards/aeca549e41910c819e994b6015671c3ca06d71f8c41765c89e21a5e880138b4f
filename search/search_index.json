It documents all events currently collected through telemetry, as well those planned for collection but not currently implemented. It will be updated periodically to reflect all new and planned data collection.\n\n\nFor similar docs relating to data collection on other platforms see \niOS\n and \nAndroid\n.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nData collection is done solely for the purpose of product development, improvement and maintenance.\n\n\nThe data collection outlined here is geared toward answering the following questions (see \nList of Implemented Events\n:\n\n\nNote that when we refer to retrieval of \"credentials\", we mean access to usernames, passwords, or both\n\n\n\n\nAre users using Lockbox to retrieve credentials?\n\n\nFor different intervals of time (e.g. day, week, month), what is:\n\n\nThe average rate with which a user retrieves a credential or reveals a password\n\n\nThe distribution of above rates across all users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes adoption of Lockbox lead to adoption of the associated Lockbox Mobile Apps?\n\n\nOnce downloaded, do users continue to use the app? (i.e., how well are they retained?)\n\n\nWe will count a user as retained in a given time interval if they perform one of the following actions:\n\n\nDisplay the credential list\n\n\nTap a credential in the credential list\n\n\nCopy a credential to the clipboard\n\n\nReveal a password\n\n\nAutofill a credential stored in Lockbox into another app\n\n\nTap the URI associated with a credential (to open it in an app or browser)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince they can be performed automatically, we will \nnot\n count a user as retained if they \nonly\n perform the following actions (in absence of any in the list above):\n\n\nUnlock their credentials\n\n\nSync their credentials from the Firefox desktop browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes requiring a Firefox Account constitute a roadblock to adoption?\n\n\nWhat proportion of new Lockbox users are pre-existing Firefox Account users?\n\n\nWhat proportion of users start the Account sign-in process but never complete it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to answering the above questions that directly concern actions in the app, we will also analyze telemetry emitted from the native password manager that exist in the the Firefox desktop browser. Users of the extension should not be having to use the native manager, so data suggesting otherwise may be a sign that something is amiss.\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nTo record Telemetry we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of \nevents\n and \nscalar measurements\n through a webextension.\n\n\nOnce telemetry is logged on the measurements should appear in \nabout:telemetry\n. From there they will be submitted in the main ping payload under \nprocesses.dynamic.events\n and available through the usual services (STMO and ATMO), as well as amplitude (eventually).\n\n\nEvent Registration and Recording\n\n\nThe events that we will record will conform to the structure expected by the telemetry pipeline. When the events are logged in telemetry they will be a list of:\n\n\n[timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra]\n\n\nThe API takes care of the timestamp for us. We just need to define \ncategory\n, \nmethod\n, \nobject\n and \nextra\n (\nvalue\n is optional and we won't use it).\n\n\nEvents are defined by \nregistering\n them using a call to \nbrowser.telemetry.registerEvents(category, eventData)\n.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of how a to register a typical event:\n\n\nbrowser.telemetry.registerEvents(\nevent_category\n, {\n    \nevent_name\n: {\n        methods: [\nclick\n, ... ], // types of events that can occur\n        objects: [\na_button\n, ... ], // objects event can occur on\n        extra: {\nkey\n: \nvalue\n, ... } // key-value pairs (strings)\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will use the \nextra\n field for a few purposes:\n\n\n\n\nTo log the UUID of the item that has been added or changed (e.g. \n\"item_id\": UUID\n)\n\n\nTo log the fields that are modified when an item is updated in the datastore (e.g. \n\"fields\": \"username,passsword,hostname\"\n (because the value has to be a string we will have to concat the fields that were updated somehow)\n\n\n\n\nOnce an event is registered, we can record it with:\n\n\nbrowser.telemetry.recordEvent(category, method, object, value, extra)\n\n\nNote: The semantics of \nvalue\n is contingent on the event being recorded, see list below.\n\n\nSee the Events section for specific examples of event registration and recording.\n\n\nScalar recording\n\n\nWe use the js api for scalar recording as well. Here registration happens with the following syntax:\n\n\nbrowser.telemetry.registerScalars(category, {\n    \nscalar_name\n: {\n        kind: browser.Telemetry.SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT, // SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT, SCALAR_TYPE_BOOLEAN. or SCALAR_TYPE_STRING\n        keyed: false,\n        record_on_release: false, // NEEDS TO BE SET TO RECORD ON RELEASE CHANNEL\n        expired: false,\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWe set scalar values in the following way:\n\n\nbrowser.telemetry.scalarSet(\n    \ncategory.scalar_name\n, value\n);\n\n\n\n\ne.g. \nlockbox-addon.loginCount\n for the scalar name.\n\n\nWe can also use \nscalarAdd\n to increment a scalar value by some amount.\n\n\nScalar Metrics\n\n\nThese are the metrics we currently collect regarding the state of the user's login storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nloginCount\n (SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT). Current count of the number of items in the user's login storage. If possible, this scalar should be set upon opening either the doorhanger or full extension interface. It need not be set \"in the background\" in the absence of any user interaction with the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nloginsAccessed\n (SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT). Total of logins accessed (copied, revealed) during the last telemetry session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Planned Metrics Events\n\n\nAll events are currently implemented under the \ncategory: lockbox-addon\n. The \nextra\n field contains \nitemid\n for events pertaining to a particular Lockbox item. They are listed and grouped together below based on the contents of the event's \nmethod\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartup\n fires when the webextension is loaded. \nobjects\n: webextension. Note that this event fires whenever the browser is started, so is not indicative of direct user interaction with Lockbox. \nvalue\n is null.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick\n fires when someone clicks on one of the UI elements listed \nobjects\n: \ntoolbar\n, \nget_mobile\n, \nfaq\n, \naccount_settings\n, \ngive_feedback\n, \nsettings_menu\n, \nreconnect_sync\n, \nsignin_sync\n (or whatever the menu is that contains links to account settings, faq, etc). \nvalue\n is null.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow\n events fire when various UI elements are rendered shown to the user. \nobjects\n: \nitem_list_manager\n, \nitem_list_doorhanger\n, \nitem_detail_doorhanger\n \nitem_detail_manager\n, \nnew_item\n, \nitem_edit\n, \ndelete_confirm\n, \nconnect_another_device\n (referring to the dialog displayed after a user clicks on the button to learn about the mobile apps) \nvalue\n should be a boolean for \nitem_list_*\n events indicating whether any logins are in the login list (e.g. \nFalse\n if the list is empty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_add\n, \nitem_update\n, \nitem_delete\n fire after a successful adding, editing or deleting of a credential. \nobjects\n: manager, doorhanger (contingent on where the user initiated the action). item GUID should be in the extra field. \nvalue\n is null\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_selected\n fires when a user clicks an item in the itemlist. \nobjects\n manager, doorhanger  \nvalue\n is null\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncopy_password\n and \ncopy_username\n fire when a user copies their username or password from an item. \nobjects\n: \nitem_detail_manager\n, \nitem_detail_doorhanger\n \nvalue\n is null. item GUID should be in the extra field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreveal_password\n fires when a user reveals a password from within the item detail view. \nobjects\n: \nitem_detail_manager\n, \nitem_detail_doorhanger\n \nvalue\n is null item GUID should be in the extra field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen_website\n fires when a user clicks to open a credential's associated web address. \nobjects\n: \nitem_detail_manager\n, \nitem_detail_doorhanger\n \nvalue\n is null item GUID should be in the extra field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDocs for the Mozilla privileged JS API that allows us to log events thru an add-on:\n\n\nTelemetry Public JS API",
